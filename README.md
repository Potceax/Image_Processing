# Image Processing Toolkit

This repository is dedicated to providing robust image processing tools implemented in three different programming languages: Python, Java, and C++. The toolkit focuses on essential image manipulation techniques such as cutting, merging, and blurring. It's designed to be versatile and efficient, leveraging popular libraries like Pillow, NumPy, and OpenCV.

## Installation

To use this toolkit, you need to install specific libraries depending on the programming language you're working with.

### C++:
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): A powerful library for computer vision and image processing tasks.

### Python:
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/): A user-friendly image library for Python, used for basic image manipulations.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Essential for handling large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- [OpenCV-Python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/): Python bindings for the OpenCV library.

### Java:
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): Java bindings for OpenCV are used for advanced image processing tasks.
- [java.awt.image](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/image/package-summary.html): Standard Java API for processing and manipulating images.

To install these libraries, follow the instructions provided on their respective websites.

## Usage

Here is a basic overview of how to use the toolkit in each language:

### C++:
- Include the OpenCV headers in your program.
- Use OpenCV functions for image loading, processing, and saving.

### Python:
- Import Pillow, NumPy, and OpenCV in your script.
- Utilize these libraries to perform image operations.

### Java:
- Set up OpenCV and java.awt.image in your Java project.
- Apply the necessary functions to carry out image processing tasks.
